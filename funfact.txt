/*
    Fun fact!
    the maximum number of holes in a memory of and even size of bytes is that size of the whole memory
    divided by 2 (first bytes is allocated, the second is not, the third is and so on). In this case the
    maximum number of Holes is 100mb/2 in bytes ~= 52 milion bytes. A single hole takes 32 bytes. So
    the vector of holes needs to be like 1.6 billion bytes => 1.5 Gb of memory.

    The maximum memory occupied in RAM by the holes of a buddy where each hole is of minimum size would be around 5MB
